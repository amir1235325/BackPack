//
// A node is a server that has been told, once, which panel manages it, and has
// been connecting outward to that panel ever since. From here it looks like a
// place a tunnel can be put: the fleet screen lists them, and the setup form
// can build both ends of a tunnel in one submission instead of leaving the
// operator to repeat every paired value on a second machine by hand.
//
// The panel holds no login for any of them. See internal/node.

// fleet owns the panel's side of the managed servers.
//
// There is no lifetime to manage any more. The channel this replaces had a
// listener per server that had to be opened, moved when its port changed, and
// closed when the server went — three things that could each be wrong on their
// own, and each of which left a server listed here and unreachable. The panel
// dials out now, so the only state worth holding is the connections it is
// reusing, and those look after themselves.
