 *
 * It used to hand the operator a line to run on the other machine and then
 * watch for that machine to appear. It does not any more: the panel logs into
 * the server over its own SSH, which is already running and already how that
 * machine is administered. So adding a server is a form and an answer, the way
 * everything else in the panel is, and there is nothing to carry anywhere.
 *
 * CLI: nothing. There is no Backpack state on a managed server to configure.

 * It was scaled to the card before, which was wrong twice. Stretched to the

 * scaled uniformly to cover, it zoomed — the same street plan came out twice
 * the size on a wide card as on a narrow one, so two cards side by side had
